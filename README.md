# liri-node-app:
- dependencies used: dotenv, inquirer, node-spotify-api, omdb, request, twitter
- LIRI uses NPM packages to help retrieve Tweets from your Twitter account, search for Spotify songs, get movie information from the OMDB API, and uses a .txt file to read whatever command lives in there to run that command using LIRI. JavaScript was used to write the logic to go between commands.
